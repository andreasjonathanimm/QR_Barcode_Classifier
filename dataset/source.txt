==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on March 10, 2022 at 1:59 PM GMT

It includes 562 images.
Qrcode are annotated in Tensorflow Object Detection format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

No image augmentation techniques were applied.
